# Meganthology
This is how we do things!

## About
This is a static site generator built with Jekyll. You only need to edit the markdown files in the html folder. That easy.

## Dependencies
First of all you need to install all the dependencies. We use quite a few:

* *Jekyll:* the static site generator engine: `gem install jekyll`
* *RDiscount:* the rubygem that parses the markdown of your pages: `gem install rdiscount`
* *Pygments:* library that is used for syntax highlighting (assuming you have python and easy_install): `easy_install Pygments`

## Usage
Once you've got all the dependencies set, you just need to run the command `jekyll --server` in the projects folder. This will create a local server (http://localhost:4000) where you can view your pretty creature.
